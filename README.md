Partner Non-Profit: Miracle Messages

We are a nonprofit reunion service to help our neighbors experiencing homelessness reunite with their loved ones in a positive and supportive way.

Frontend deployed on: https://miracle-messages-after-labs14.netlify.com



Mission: "I didn't realize I was homeless until I lost my friends and family"

We believe everyone is somebody's someone, and no one should be defined by what they lack. Miracle Messages Map connects volunteers, making it easy to join together to reunite more homeless people with their families.
