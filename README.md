# Front-End


Partner Non-Profit: Miracle Messages
Project: Miracle Messages Volunteer Map

We are a nonprofit reunion service to help our neighbors experiencing homelessness reunite with their loved ones in a positive and supportive way.

Frontend deployed on: https://miracle-messages-after-labs14.netlify.com

Admin panel route: https://miracle-messages-after-labs14.netlify.com/admin



Mission: "I didn't realize I was homeless until I lost my friends and family"

We believe everyone is somebody's someone, and no one should be defined by what they lack. Miracle Messages Map displays volunteer and reunion activity, enabling site visitors to join as volunteers to reunite more people ex people with their families.
